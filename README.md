# Docker Flow
Manage workflow running in Docker containers. 

With Docker Flow you can define your workflow in yaml files, docker-flow reads the container requirements and execution steps for each job, and uses docker-compose to define Dockerfiles, container linkings and exposed ports, builds docker images, and runs composed application stack in Docker swarm.
