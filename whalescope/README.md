# WhaleScope: a Docker Monitor UI
This is an UI application to monitor Docker from any given host.
We'll build this application in order to have a way to monitor any action from variuos hosts and also control them from a clean UI.
We'll be capable of run, stop and kill containers. And also We'll check the status of all our containers.
This way non-technical people can get intimate with docker.

# Next steps:
 - Let the user add hosts to control.
 - Add graphs of the container status.
 - Add search from Registry and let the user download and start from it.
 - Add Stop and Start button to container view.
